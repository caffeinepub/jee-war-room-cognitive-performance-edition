  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all four requirements (REQ-94, REQ-95, REQ-96, REQ-97) for visual revision tracking toggles in the MasterPCMChapterSystem component. The implementation includes toggle buttons with green checkmark/red cross icons, backend integration via the updateChapterRevision mutation hook, real-time percentage calculation, and mobile-responsive layout. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the evidence in the modified files.",
